## Data Sources

| Data | Source | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| Street Network | OSM via OSMnx | Routing |
| Tree Canopy | Philly Land Cover | Shade estimation |
| Buildings | OpenDataPhilly | Shadow calculation |
| SEPTA Stops | GTFS | Destinations |

## Shade Estimation

### Tree Canopy

We buffered each street segment by 3m and calculated...

### Building Shadows

Using building heights and solar position (pvlib), we calculated...

## Routing Algorithm

The shadiest path uses modified edge weights:
```python
shade_weight = length * (1 - reward * shade_score)
```

Where `reward = 0.3` based on pedestrian behavior studies...

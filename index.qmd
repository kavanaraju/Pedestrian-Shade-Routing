## Introduction

Urban heat islands and rising temperatures make shade increasingly critical for pedestrian comfort during transit access trips. This project develops a shade-optimized routing system for University City Philadelphia, using high-resolution LiDAR data to model realistic shadow coverage across the pedestrian network.

### Research Question

**How can pedestrians optimize their walking routes to transit stops to maximize shade coverage while minimizing detour distance?**

### Study Area

University City, Philadelphia encompasses approximately 4.2 square miles of dense urban fabric serving the University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University campuses. The area features:

- Major transit infrastructure (SEPTA Market-Frankford Line)
- Dense tree canopy coverage
- Mix of residential and commercial land uses
- 23,486 pedestrian network segments

### Project Significance

This analysis addresses a critical gap in pedestrian routing research by:

1. **Using actual building and tree heights** from LiDAR data (not estimates)
2. **Modeling temporal variation** across seasons and times of day
3. **Quantifying trade-offs** between distance efficiency and thermal comfort
4. **Providing actionable routing strategies** for pedestrians

### Approach Overview

This project implements a complete pipeline from data acquisition to interactive visualization:

1. **Data Collection** - LiDAR point clouds, building footprints, street network, transit stops
2. **Shade Modeling** - Geometric shadow calculation from building and tree heights
3. **Route Optimization** - Shade-weighted Dijkstra pathfinding algorithm
4. **Visualization** - Static maps and interactive routing calculator

## Motivation

Climate change is intensifying urban heat islands, making shade a critical factor in pedestrian route choice. Studies show:

- Pedestrians willing to walk up to 50% further for shaded routes in summer
- Surface temperatures in shade can be 15-30°F cooler than direct sun
- Shade significantly impacts walking comfort, especially for transit access trips

Yet most routing applications (Google Maps, Apple Maps) **ignore shade entirely**, optimizing only for distance or time.

This project demonstrates that:

✓ Shade can be accurately modeled using LiDAR data  
✓ Optimal routes can balance distance and thermal comfort  
✓ Real-time shade routing is computationally feasible

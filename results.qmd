## Shade Source Analysis

### Building vs Tree Contribution

![Building and Tree Contributions](figures/building_vs_tree_contribution.png){width=100%}

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Finding: Buildings Dominate in Winter, Trees Critical in Summer

**Winter Morning:**
- Buildings: **74.4%** shade contribution
- Trees: 42.1% shade contribution
- **Explanation:** Low sun angle creates extremely long building shadows

**Summer Midday:**
- Buildings: 16.3% shade contribution
- Trees: **35.9%** shade contribution
- **Explanation:** High sun reduces building shadow length; tree canopies become primary shade source
:::

**Urban Planning Implications:**
- **Winter:** Building height and orientation critical
- **Summer:** Tree canopy programs essential for pedestrian comfort
- **Year-round:** Combined approach maximizes shade availability
